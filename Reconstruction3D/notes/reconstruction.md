SfM is traditional method. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a popular approach.

Several papers on neural scene representation and view synthesis

* [Neural Body](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15838). 2021. [blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/342785203). only require few-view images
* Neural Volumes
* NeRF/iNeRF/PixelNeRF
* [NeRF-W](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02268)
* Scene representation networks (SSNs)
* local light-field fusion (LLFF)



Reconstruction:
