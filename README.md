# 3D

The workflow for my 3D imaging research is modularized into three main components:

* [Reconstruction3D](./Reconstruction3D). 
  * For the reconstruction of individual aggregates serving as the prototypes during scene synthesis, the software Agisoft Metashape Professional was used. Details are described in this [document](./Reconstruction3D/notes/agisoft_metashape_guide/agisoft_metashape_guide.md).
  * For the reconstruction of stockpile scene in real application, the open-source software Meshroom is used. Details are described in this document [placholder]().
* [Synthesis3D](./Synthesis3D)
  * The synthesis workflow is described in this [document](./Synthesis3D/notes/synthesis_guide/synthesis.md)
* [Segmentation3D](./Segmentation3D)
